## Welcome!!

First of all, I want to introduce myself. I am Buket Varilci, currently junior in Turkish High School. I created a website about astronomy because I know that so many people in Turkey what to learn astronomy but it seems diffucult to understand. I been in these places so I wanted to help people. I also did translate some of the word; to make people understand. I believe this website can help people to learn new English words also my main point to teach astronomy in basic level.
